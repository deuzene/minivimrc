minivimrc
=========

This **minivimrc** started its life as a very small `vimrc` I put together while working on a friend's dedicated server. Since then, it slowly became a sophisticated but compact `vimrc` that—with only a bit under 100 LOC—provides *me* many useful and opinionated improvements to Vim's defaults **without** depending on any third-party or perverting my favorite editor's philosophy and design.

One could think of it as a demonstration of what can be achieved with only a tiny bit of configuration.

**Don't use it if you don't understand what's in there!**
