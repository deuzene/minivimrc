minivimrc
=========

`minivimrc` is the smallest `.vimrc` I could come up with.

It contains only what *I* consider to be the most basic settings *I* need in order to make Vim comfortable. The whole thing could be condensed in a one liner, probably, but itâ€™s clearer that way.

Don't use if you don't understand what's in there!
