minivimrc
=========

This **minivimrc** started its life as a very small `vimrc` I put together while working on a friend's server. Since then, it slowly became a sophisticated but compact `vimrc` that provides quite a lot of useful improvements to Vim's default behaviour **without** introducing any external dependency or perverting my favorite editor's philosophy and design.

Don't use it if you don't understand what's in there!
